\b0 \cf0 	On OS X 10.2 and higher added support for Keyboard Detection, OSXvnc should now  be able to hit any SINGLE key that is present in the users currently selected keyboard\
	Whole screen has problem in 256 color mode\
	Bundles performance optimization\
	Test pressMods for keys with Foreign Keyboard\
		Works but not for sticky key - make this loading a selected behavior\
		Also has problems with things like SHIFT Arrows, CTRL Arrows, etc.\
\
	Move Disable Logic To Puma Bundle - Necessary for 10.0?\
	Add GUI to disable Mod Key Swtiching (including GUI)\
\
Mouse Cursor:\
	Occasional cursor artifacts (disabling cursor display didn't seem to help)\
	Problem with partial transparency on cursors - displayed using threshold\
\
Fix problem where pasteboard isn't shared when run as StartupItem\
	Tricky, the loginserver specifically disconnects our port to the pbs, could try something with -LoginHook to reconnect it.\
\
Fix so that server doesn't die when user logs out \
	Tried using demonize, didn't seem to fix it, I think it needs to be the run loop which shuts down\
\
Fix so server runs under 10.0\
	Beta testing\
\
Add Preference Pane for Configuring For System Startup\
\
Update Dock Icon with Badging As Users Connect\
	When server is started show badge with 0\
\
Option to set background to Black on Connect\
	(
\f2\fs20 /System/Library/Frameworks/ScreenSaver.framework/Resources/ScreenSaverEngine.app/Contents/MacOS/ScreenSaverEngine -background -module "" &)\

\f0\fs24 \

\
Improved International Keyboard Support:\
	Figure out how to work with Sticky keys\
	Dynamicall Determine \
\
Disable the screen-blanking/screen-saver while people are connected\
	It does some of this, must verify\
\
Fix bug when running with local screen in 256 Color Mode\
\
Fix bug in CoRRE\
\
Support For Multiple Physical Displays\
	Have some basics in but haven't resolved dealing with the multiple screens as part of a larger screen area (need to translate events, etc.)\
	\
Figure out if we can make headless displays work\
\
Replace -localhost
\f2\fs20 \cf2 \CocoaLigature0  
\f0\fs24 \cf0 \CocoaLigature1 with full -vncauth file\
\
Add inetd/xinetd support\
	So OSXvnc will startup when a request comes in	\
	Look  in RealVNC 4.0 for example\
\
Add "Send Full Screen" Mode - Useful for things like Keynote which bypasses CGRemoteOperations API\
	Possibly Detect when machine enters such a mode - ie starts running Keynote\
\
Paint in Local Mouse Cursor\
	Make It An Option\
	Try using the rfbLocalBuffer logic - BUT instead of running the whole screen through that \
	Just send an update for cursor position when cursor moves. Or when other updates go out.\
